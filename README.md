# 👋 Hi, I’m Ronny (pezezzle)

**Full-Stack .NET Developer & Game Developer**

## 🚧 Current Main Project – **FMwerkstatt**
A multi-tenant **CAFM / CMMS SaaS** built with:

- **.NET 9**, ASP.NET Core WebAPI  
- **Entity Framework Core 9**, SQL Server  
- **Multi-tenant architecture** (Provider, Identity, WorkManagement)
